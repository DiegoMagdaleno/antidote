general:
	- Add completions file
	- Add a man page @documentation
	- Do we want to change the CLI to mimic the now defunct antibody to serve as a drop-in replacement? @maybe
	- Add more tests @never-really-done
	- Add support for branches @cli
	- Comparison table of other ZSH plugin managers @documentation

commands:
	clone:
		- explore whether mafredri/zsh-async should be used for parallelism with cloning @inprogress
	source:
		- add a cache file for speed - I'm thinking store initfile results in an associative array when we had to search @inprogress
		- source should allow paths to any directory rather than just assuming plugins
		  For example - pz source ~/my_custom_plugin
	prompt:
		- do we even want this feature or is a prompt a special plugin?? @maybe
	zcompile:
		- Consider an auto-zcompile feature during clone/pull operations @maybe
		- Consider exclusions from zcompile (maybe take plugins as parameters for inclusion)

plugin spec:
	- consider implementing plugin "standard" https://zdharma.org/Zsh-100-Commits-Club/Zsh-Plugin-Standard.html
