general:
	- Add completions file
	- Ensure seamless integration as an OMZ plugin manager with $ZSH_CUSTOM @documentation
	- Prezto plugins may have a functions directory that should be added to fpath
	- Add a man page @documentation
	- Do we want to change the CLI to mimic the now defunct antibody to serve as a drop-in replacement? @maybe
	- Add more tests @never-really-done
	- Consider an auto-zcompile feature during clone/pull operations @maybe

commands:
	clone:
		- explore whether mafredri/zsh-async should be used for parallelism with cloning
	source:
		- add a cache file for speed - I'm thinking store initfile results in zstyle settings
		- source should allow paths to any directory rather than just assuming plugins
		For example - pz source ~/my_custom_plugin
	prompt:
		- do we even want this feature or is a prompt a special plugin?? @maybe
